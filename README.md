# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
 
The purpose of this analysis was to find a correlations between student performance and schools budgeting. Understanding the students performance trends based on budget will help the school board  make informed decisions regarding the schools budget allotments.

## Results

- There is no difference between my original analysis and my updated analysis. The district summary for both analysis we exactly the same.


- In regards to the the school summary, there was only a slight change for Thomas High School's overall performance, their scored t dropped by about 0.3%.


- Considering that the school boards budgeting and decision making is based on the students performance, it is ideal to collect the accurate information. With there being evidence of academic dishonesty with the ninth graders their test scores could significantly change the overall score for the school.  With the information being skewed all the calculations for the overall passing percentage would be off. The school spending could be incorrect. 

## Summary

After we replace the scores of the ninth grade students we learn that not much has changed. We changed the values that could've altered the spending and overall passing percentage of the students, along with other information, like school size and district school type.
